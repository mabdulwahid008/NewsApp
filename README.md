This is my 2nd React Project during Learning Phase.

In which I learned API integration.

I got free API from NewsApi and integrated it to my app for news.

The navebar shows the categories of news and redirect to that category of news.

I fixed the page size for rendering News from API and loading animation for rendering more News on bottom.
